# Health Score

This application is designed to track your physical activity based on the number of steps you take. It uses the [recommendations of the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) regarding moderate and vigorous physical activity.

The app calculates the number of steps taken in the current minute and classifies the activity level as either 'active' (100 steps per minute) or 'intense' (130 steps per minute). It then stores this data and calculates an overall activity score, which is displayed on the screen.

## Usage

After installing the app, it will automatically start tracking your steps and classifying your activity level. The app will display your current activity score, which is calculated based on the total active and intense minutes over the past 7 days.

## Features

- Real-time step tracking
- Classification of activity level into 'active' and 'intense'
- Calculation of overall activity score based on WHO recommendations
- Display of current activity score and breakdown of active and intense minutes
- Utilizes the `clkinfo` module to export the current activity score in percentage for use with clock faces

## Controls
